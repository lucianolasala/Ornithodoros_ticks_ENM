Introduction
----------  
This repository contains the R scripts and details of methods employed for the development and transfer of ecological niche models (henceforth ENM) for Wild boar (*Sus scrofa*) in contiguous Argentina and neighboring countries.
This repository serves as a dynamic document for other parties interested on the ecology of Wild boar and it will be updated as additional data is gathered and new methodological methods are developed. 
The code included in the repository is divided into a series of separate scripts that should be run sequentially.

A Maximum Entropy approach (https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/) method was used inside the R programing environment (https://www.r-project.org/).
