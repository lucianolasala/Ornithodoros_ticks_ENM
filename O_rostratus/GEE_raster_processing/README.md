### Google Earth Engine data processing
----------
Clould computing using Google Earth Engine (https://earthengine.google.com/) is described for each of the variables included in model calibration area. For this species, only one asset (i.e. calibration area) was defined using vector files (ESRI shapefiles). In the code shown, remote sensing data are processed by clipping each product to that region. All the analyses were implemented using the Earth Engine API available in Javascript.
